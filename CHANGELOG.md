HOW TO ADD A NEW RELEASE ENTRY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. While developing, accumulate notes under the `## [Unreleased]` heading
   below, grouped by the standard Keep a Changelog sections:
     ### ✨ Added       — new features users can see
     ### 🔄 Changed     — changes in existing functionality
     ### ⚠️ Deprecated  — soon-to-be removed features
     ### 🗑️ Removed     — removed features
     ### 🐛 Fixed       — bug fixes
     ### 🔒 Security    — security-related fixes
     ### 🧪 Test Coverage Expansion — test-only changes (project convention)

2. When cutting a release (e.g. v1.0.2):

   a) Bump version in: package.json + manifest.config.ts + CHANGELOG below
   b) Replace `## [Unreleased]` with `## [1.0.2] — YYYY-MM-DD`
   c) Add a fresh `## [Unreleased]` heading at the top with empty subsections,
      so the next cycle has somewhere to write
   d) Update the comparison links at the bottom of this file (if/when added)
   e) Tag the commit:  git tag v1.0.2 && git push --tags
   f) Draft a GitHub Release (Releases → Draft new release → choose tag),
      paste the same changelog section as the release notes
   g) Trigger the Chrome Web Store upload workflow (or upload manually)

3. Audience reminder: end users read this file. Lead with WHAT changed and
   WHY they care, not implementation detail. Save deep technical notes for
   commit messages or PR descriptions.

4. Quick template to copy when starting a new release block:

       ## [X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD

## [1.0.8] — 2026-06-11

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Pro upgrade modal opening two tabs**: Clicking "Get Pro →" in the Pro upgrade modal opened two browser tabs instead of one. Caused by a duplicate click handler in both the Preact component and the legacy `license-ui.ts` event binding.
- **Settings variable hint alignment**: The "Variables: {domain}, {index}…" hint text below the filename input now aligns with the input field instead of sitting flush-left.

### 🔄 Changed

- **Filename label**: Chinese locale label changed from "文件名" to "文件名称" for better visual alignment with "子文件夹".

### 🧹 Housekeeping

- **Production build localhost guard**: `npm run zip` now scans the built `dist/` folder for any `localhost` URLs before packaging. If found (e.g. from a leftover `.env.local`), the script aborts with a clear error message, preventing accidental deployment of dev-targeted builds.

---

## [1.0.7] — 2026-06-10

### ✨ Added

- **Collection Batch Operations**: Select all, batch download, and batch delete for saved collections. Includes a selected/total count indicator and confirmation dialog for destructive actions.
- **Collection URL Search**: New search-by-URL input in the collection modal for quickly finding specific saved images.
- **Batch-specific Pro Toast Messages**: Batch favorite, batch AI tag, and batch delete now show feature-specific quota limit messages instead of a generic "batch limit" toast.
- **AI Tag Quota Pre-check**: Single and batch AI tagging now verify remaining free quota _before_ sending API requests, showing the Pro upgrade modal immediately instead of a confusing "tag failed" error.
- **Remote Config: Partial Sync**: New incremental remote config sync via `fetchPartialRemoteConfig()` — only refreshes stale keys instead of fetching the full config every time, reducing bandwidth and latency.

### 🔄 Changed

- **Pro Upgrade Modal Redesign**: Completely overhauled with clearer feature comparison table, reordered feature rows (free-limited features first, Pro-only features last), and better visual hierarchy. "Advanced grouping" moved from Pro-only to limited-free (format grouping free, all modes Pro).
- **Quota Display Overhaul**: `QuotaDisplay` rewritten to support remote-driven feature copy. Rows, labels, and ordering are now fetched from the server and fall back to a hardcoded layout when offline. "Free" column header now uses i18n (`quota_header_free`) instead of hardcoded English.
- **Quota Text Unified**: `quota_unlimited` changed from "不限" to "无限制" across all Chinese locales, aligning with `pro_compare_unlimited` and the official website.
- **Pro Badge Sizing**: `.pro-badge-mini` enlarged from 7px→8px base with better padding and margin. Icon-button badges (`icon-btn-wrapper .pro-badge-mini`) enlarged from 5px→6px with improved positioning.
- **Format Conversion**: Removed PRO badge from the format conversion dropdown label — the feature uses soft quota (free users get limited monthly conversions), not a hard Pro gate.
- **Modal Scroll Reset**: All modals (settings, Pro upgrade, collection, multi-tab, dedup) now reset `scrollTop` synchronously on open, with a `requestAnimationFrame` fallback for hidden-element edge cases.
- **Batch AI Tag Error Handling**: `batchAiTag()` now distinguishes `monthly_limit` / `pro_required` / `quota_exceeded` errors and shows the Pro upgrade modal instead of a generic failure toast.
- **StatusCounts & Init Flow**: Improved startup sequence and status count rendering for better first-paint experience.

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Modal scroll position**: Opening a modal no longer shows stale scroll position from the previous session — all modals scroll to top on open.
- **AI tag failure on quota exhaustion**: Free users with exhausted AI tag quota now correctly see the Pro upgrade modal instead of "AI 标签失败，请重试".
- **Reverse search tab tracking**: Fixed edge cases in tab lifecycle management for reverse image search results.
- **Highlight overlay clicks**: Improved reliability of highlight dismiss on complex page layouts.

### 🌍 i18n

- **88 new English keys**: Added keys for collection batch ops, batch-specific Pro limits, quota display, color copy, and feature comparison.
- **Full catalogue sync**: All 15 language files updated. zh_TW received localized translations for batch limit messages; other languages use English fallback.

### 🧹 Housekeeping

- **Debug logs cleaned**: Removed remaining `console.log` from `background/reverse-search.ts` (Baidu upload debug). Previously flagged `background/license.ts` and `background/index.ts` logs were already cleaned in prior commits.
- **DEV guard confirmed**: `TEST_MATCH_REFERRAL` message handler is properly wrapped in `import.meta.env.DEV` check.

### 🧪 Test Coverage

- **4 test files updated**: Tests synchronized with modal scroll reset changes, collection UI additions, batch ops quota pre-checks, and Pro feature guard updates.

---

## [1.0.6] — 2026-06-05

### ✨ Added

- **Referral & Invite System**: Share your unique invite link with friends. When they install Image Harvest, both you and your friend earn bonus trial days. Includes a new in-panel `ReferralBanner` for free users and a dedicated invite landing page on the website.
- **Remote Feature Configuration**: Feature limits (free quotas, Pro caps) are now fetched from the server and cached locally, allowing real-time adjustments without releasing a new extension version. Three-tier cache: memory → chrome.storage → network with 1-hour TTL.
- **Quota Display Panel**: New `QuotaDisplay` component in settings shows a clear Free vs Pro comparison table, grouped into Core Pro / AI / Batch Ops / Storage categories. Free users see remaining quota; Pro users see used/total.
- **Visibility Filter**: New "Show visible only" toggle filters out images that are off-screen or hidden behind overlays. Uses real-time `IntersectionObserver` + `getComputedStyle` checks in the content script.
- **Color Extraction now free**: Color palette extraction is no longer a Pro-only feature — all users can see dominant colors for every image.
- **Image MIME detection from bytes**: `detectImageMimeFromBytes` inspects file magic bytes (PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP/BMP/ICO/SVG) for reliable format identification, replacing extension-based guessing.

### 🔄 Changed

- **Pro features → soft quota model**: Instead of hard-blocking free users, Pro features now use a monthly/daily quota system (`feature-quota.ts`). Free users get a limited number of uses per month; Pro users get unlimited access. Affected features: multi-tab extraction, dedup detection, format conversion, live monitor, batch highlight.
- **AI quota from daily to monthly**: Free AI tagging quota changed from per-day to per-month, giving users more flexibility in how they use their allowance.
- **srcset handling**: `extractImgTags` now picks the single highest-resolution URL from `srcset` instead of listing every candidate — significantly reduces duplicate entries.
- **Pricing updated**: Monthly $3.99 / Yearly $29.99 / Lifetime $49.99 (previously $2.99/$19.99/$29.99).
- **ProUpgradeModal redesign**: Rewritten upgrade modal with improved UX — clearer feature comparison, better visual hierarchy, and smoother animations (241 lines of changes).
- **Content script refactor**: `content/main.ts` restructured for better maintainability (+275 lines), with new utility functions extracted to `content/utils.ts`.
- **Init flow optimization**: `sidepanel/init.ts` expanded (+188 lines) with improved startup sequence, remote config sync, and referral matching on first install.
- **Settings improvements**: Enhanced settings panel with new options and better organization (+132 lines).

### 🎨 UI/UX

- **License page restyled**: Completely new license activation/management CSS (+308 lines) with modern card layout.
- **Toolbar refinements**: Updated toolbar styling (+81 lines) with better spacing and icon alignment.
- **Cards & grid polish**: Minor visual improvements to image card rendering and grid layout.

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Highlight overlay positioning**: Improved accuracy of highlight overlays for images in complex layouts (scrollable containers, CSS transforms).
- **Highlight click dismiss**: Overlay click handler rewritten to use document-level capture with `pointer-events: none` on overlays, fixing issues where clicks wouldn't register on overlaid content.

### 🌍 i18n

- **290+ new translation keys per language**: All 15 language files updated with comprehensive translations for referral system, quota display, visibility filter, updated Pro features, and revised upgrade modal content.

### 🧪 Test Coverage

- **11 test files updated**: Tests synchronized with quota model changes, visibility filter, referral system, and pricing updates.

### ⚠️ Known Issues

- **4 debug `console.log` statements** remain in `background/license.ts:19`, `background/reverse-search.ts:245,252`, `background/index.ts:204` — should be cleaned before final submission.
- **`TEST_MATCH_REFERRAL` message handler** in `background/index.ts` lacks a production environment guard — consider wrapping in `__DEV__` check.

---

## [1.0.5] — 2026-06-02

### ✨ Added

- **AI Image Tagging**: Generate smart tags for images using AI — helps you find and organize images by content. Free users get a daily quota; Pro users enjoy unlimited tagging.
- **Batch AI Tagging**: Tag multiple selected images at once with a single click.
- **AI Tag Filtering**: Filter images by AI-generated tags in the search/filter toolbar.
- **Export to Eagle**: One-click export images (with metadata, tags, and source URL) to Eagle — the popular design asset management app. Supports batch export of selected images. Free users can export up to 5 images; Pro users enjoy unlimited exports.
- **Batch Operations Toolbar**: New batch action buttons appear when images are selected — batch favorite (add to collection), batch AI tag, and batch delete. Streamlines bulk workflows without opening menus.

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Dropdown menus stay open after clicking**: The reverse-image-search and download-format dropdown menus now dismiss immediately after clicking a button or menu item, instead of staying open until the cursor leaves.
- **Image list re-renders after reverse search**: Switching to the reverse-search tab and back no longer causes the image list to re-render (which reset the scroll position to the top).
- **Loading state stuck after reverse search**: Fixed a race condition where scanning the transient reverse-search extension page could leave the image grid permanently stuck in a loading state.
- **Status counts flash on tab switch**: Switching between the extension's built-in pages (welcome, reverse-search) and normal tabs no longer triggers a re-render of the "Found N images (N similar)" counter with a fade-in animation.

## [1.0.4] — 2026-05-25

### 🚀 Optimization Sprint — Stability, Performance & Architecture

This release focuses heavily on **tab-switch reliability**, **CORS bypass for file metadata**, **code architecture improvements**, and **Pro modal UX redesign**. It also completes remaining i18n gaps, fixes multiple extraction edge cases, and adds security hardening.

### ✨ Added

- **Background proxy for image file size (CORS bypass)**: New `FETCH_IMAGE_META` message type lets the sidepanel request HEAD metadata through the background service worker when direct CORS HEAD fails. A third-tier fallback computes size from the base64 `dataUrl` payload. Result: file sizes now display correctly for cross-origin images (e.g. CDN-hosted assets) that previously showed blank.
- **Tab lifecycle module**: Extracted all tab management logic from the monolithic `init.ts` (1500+ lines) into a dedicated `sidepanel/tab-lifecycle.ts` module for improved maintainability and reduced bug surface.
- **Live monitor `seenUrls` auto-clear**: `startLiveMonitoring` now clears the dedup set on each invocation and caps growth at `SEEN_URLS_MAX_SIZE`, preventing unbounded memory growth on long-lived SPA pages.
- **Lazy-load listener cleanup via AbortController**: Live monitor now uses an `AbortController` to batch-remove all lazy-image `load` event listeners on `stopLiveMonitoring`, preventing leaks.
- **CSS content image extraction restored**: Re-enabled `extractCssContentImages` (was accidentally disabled) and integrated `::before`/`::after` CSS content URL extraction into the main background-image pass for better coverage.
- **URL validator security hardening**: New `shared/url-validator.ts` module with `isAllowedFetchUrl()` blocks private IPs, localhost, `.local`/`.internal` hostnames — applied to `FETCH_IMAGE_DATA` and `FETCH_IMAGE_META` to prevent SSRF.
- **Extraction re-entry guard**: `extractImages()` now returns early if already running, preventing duplicate concurrent extractions.
- **Pro upgrade modal i18n keys**: Added `pro_feature_*` description keys for all 15 supported languages.
- **Telemetry opt-in default changed to `true`**: Anonymous telemetry is now opt-in by default (was `false`).

### 🎨 UI/UX

- **Pro upgrade modal redesign**: Features displayed as cards with colored gradient icons; sections reordered (activation → trial → features → pricing); improved spacing and Pro-specific feature descriptions.
- **Dark mode CSS variable consolidation**: Migrated 8+ hardcoded color values (`#e53e3e`, `#5a3e00`, etc.) into `css/variables.css` theme tokens for consistent dark-mode contrast.
- **Empty state layout**: Top-aligned with no re-entry animation for a cleaner, less distracting feel.
- **Skeleton card viewport-aware count**: Uses `800px` default height with `ResizeObserver` recalculation so skeleton placeholders fill the full viewport on first panel open.
- **Filter bar responsive**: Toolbar filter area now adapts to narrow panel widths without overflow.
- **Restricted-page hero styling**: Tab-switch to `chrome://` or other restricted pages now shows a proper hero state instead of broken rendering.

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Tab-switch grid flash (multiple root causes)**:
  - Deep-copy cached arrays on tab restore to prevent cross-tab mutation.
  - Verify tab URL before revealing cached images.
  - Preemptive grid hide before async data load.
  - Guard `loadCurrentTab` against stale tab-switch resumption.
  - Prevent flash of stale cards on cached tab switch.
- **Background SW reconnection on idle disconnect**: Side panel now auto-reconnects to the background service worker after Chrome suspends it (idle > 30s), keeping tab-switch and messaging alive.
- **Filter conditions apply to dedup/similar modals**: The duplicate detection modal image list and the similar-image badge count now respect currently active filter settings.
- **Grid visibility after filter change**: Fixed issue where changing filters then rescanning could leave the image grid invisible.
- **Tab-switch to restricted page**: Switching to a `chrome://`, `edge://`, or other restricted-scheme tab no longer causes rendering errors; the fast-path is skipped and a preemptive grid hide prevents stale content.
- **Empty state restore on tab-switch**: Returning to an empty tab now correctly re-displays the empty-state hero instead of a blank panel.
- **Delete button Pro gate removed**: Image deletion is now free for all users as intended (removed incorrect Pro guard that was accidentally left in).
- **Force rescan on panel open**: Opening the side panel now always triggers a fresh scan to ensure images are up-to-date.
- **Skeleton cards fill viewport on first open**: No longer shows an incorrect count based on a hardcoded assumption; uses actual viewport height.
- **`extractCssContentImages` disabled by accident**: Restored the function call and changed the default opt-in flag from `false` to `true`.

### ⚡ Performance

- **Collection (IndexedDB) refactor**: Replaced nested `new Promise(async ...)` anti-patterns with clean `async/await` + a shared `requestToPromise` helper. Reduces code by ~60 lines and eliminates a class of silent swallowed errors.
- **`shared/storage.ts` simplification**: Flattened callback-style storage access into direct `await chrome.storage.local.get/set` calls.
- **`shared/phash.ts` cleanup**: Simplified internal buffer handling.
- **`shared/color-extract.ts` optimization**: Improved color quantization path.
- **Sidepanel bundle size check**: Updated the bundle size threshold in `check-bundle-size.mjs`.

### 🔒 Security

- **SSRF prevention on `FETCH_IMAGE_DATA`**: Added `isAllowedFetchUrl()` validation before the background service worker fetches arbitrary URLs, blocking private networks, loopback, and internal hostnames.
- **Same check on new `FETCH_IMAGE_META`**: HEAD proxy also validates URLs before issuing requests.

### 🌍 i18n

- **Complete locale coverage**: Replaced all remaining hardcoded English strings in sidepanel components (`filter.ts`, `settings.ts`, `ui.ts`, `dedup-ui.ts`, `collection-ui.ts`, `message.ts`, `scan.ts`, `init.ts`) with `t()` calls.
- **New i18n keys**: Added ~100 new message keys across all 15 locale files for filter labels, toast messages, modal content, Pro feature descriptions, and error messages.
- **Locale file formatting**: Reformatted all 15 `messages.json` files for consistency.

### 🔄 Changed

- **`prettier.config.ts` → `prettier.config.mjs`**: Renamed config file to ESM extension for broader tooling compatibility.
- **`versions/` → `releases/`**: Reorganized release archive directory structure (subdirectory per version).
- **`content/main.ts` re-entry guard**: `extractImages` now returns `[]` immediately if already running instead of allowing parallel extractions.
- **State additions**: Added `TIMING` constants object and `SEEN_URLS_MAX_SIZE` to `shared/constants.ts`.
- **`shared/types.ts`**: Added new field to support Pro feature description rendering.

### 🧪 Test Coverage

- **1400 tests** across 53 test files (up from 1388 in v1.0.3).
- Updated `imageCard.test.tsx` to reflect delete-button Pro gate removal.
- Updated `sidepanel-dedup-ui`, `sidepanel-message`, `sidepanel-render`, `sidepanel-filter` test files for new i18n and filter behaviors.
- Added new filter test cases for dedup-modal filtering and similar-count filtering.
- Added trial test cases for network-error and persistence-failure scenarios.

## [1.0.3] — 2026-05-14

### 🌍 Expanded Language Support

- **15 languages now supported**: Added Korean, Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Russian, Dutch, Polish, Arabic, and Thai — bringing the total from 5 to 15. Every string in the UI, error messages, and settings is fully translated.

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Side panel image list not rendering on open**: Fixed a race condition where opening the side panel (especially after switching from popup mode) would show "Found 0 images" even though images were cached. Root cause: store subscriptions registered too late to catch synchronous state mutations during initialization.
- **Settings language switch not updating all labels**: Changing the display language now immediately refreshes the modal title, license plan badge ("Lifetime"), expiry text ("Never expires"), and hotkey button label without needing to close and reopen Settings.
- **Rating prompt modal not centered**: The "Rate Image Harvest" dialog now appears centered in the viewport, consistent with all other modals.
- **Hotkey display not updating after change**: The shortcut key shown in Settings now auto-refreshes when you return from `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`; added `cursor: pointer` on the hotkey row to indicate it's clickable.
- **Image highlights lost after download**: Selection state and page highlights are now preserved after downloading images.
- **Multi-tab extraction clearing selection**: Selection and highlights no longer disappear after completing a multi-tab extraction.
- **Highlight positioning for duplicate URLs**: Fixed incorrect highlight overlay placement when the same image URL appears multiple times on a page.
- **Images behind interaction layers skipped**: Highlight now correctly skips images hidden behind modals/overlays that require user interaction.
- **Popup mode rendering glitches**: Fixed popup-only rendering issues and removed stale dynamic CSS injection.
- **Size filter X button default state**: The clear button in size filter inputs now shows the correct initial state.
- **Tab-switch flicker**: Eliminated a visible flash when switching between tabs with cached image data.

### ⚡ Performance

- **Faster image loading**: Parallelized `ensureImageLoaded` calls, reducing scan-to-render latency by ~30% on image-heavy pages.
- **Faster settings save**: Optimized settings persistence to avoid redundant writes; UI feedback is now instant.

### 🔄 Changed

- **PRO badge alignment in dropdowns**: All PRO badges in download format, group-by, and settings dropdowns are now right-aligned for visual consistency.

### 🧪 Test Coverage

- Added 14 dedicated test cases for the store→component rendering pipeline (`storeHook.test.tsx`, `imageGrid.test.tsx`) to prevent future regressions in the image list main flow.
