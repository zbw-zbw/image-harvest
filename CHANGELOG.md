## [Unreleased]

### 🧪 Test Coverage Expansion

No production code changed in this entry — purely additive test hardening.

#### Added — E2E Tests (Playwright)

Unit coverage plateaued at 80% all-files, with three holdout files stuck well below: `sidepanel/scan.ts` at **10.08%**, `sidepanel/actions.ts` at **20.50%**, `sidepanel/init.ts` at **37.05%**. Each of these is dominated by the `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` IPC boundary + top-level IIFEs that unit tests cannot reach without mocking the whole extension runtime (which would be pinning mocks, not code). The pragmatic answer is Playwright: load the real MV3 extension + real sidepanel page + fixture HTTP server, drive the `__IH__` e2e test hook to put state into the shapes each branch expects, then assert the DOM + state after. **24 new e2e cases** across 3 new spec files, all green under `npx playwright test` locally.

- `e2e/scan-fetch-pipeline.e2e.ts` (**NEW**, 15 cases) — pins the main scan state machine in `sidepanel/scan.ts` below the IPC boundary. **3 overlay primitives** — `showScanOverlay` flips `scanProgress.visible=true` and stamps `.scanning-disabled` on `.toolbar + .status-bar`; `hideScanOverlay` resets visible + indeterminate + currentUrl and strips the class; `updateScanProgress` flips `indeterminate: false` ONLY when total>0 (the total===0 preserves-indeterminate semantics is the crux of the discovering→progress handoff). **3 patchCardExtras DOM patch pins** (scan.ts L584-642) — filesize tag back-fill when `estimatedSize` arrives post-scan, format-tag `UNKNOWN→WEBP` uppercase rewrite, null-`elements.imageGrid` defensive no-op. **1 data:URI size derivation** — the `Math.floor((b64.length*3)/4) - padding` formula in `processImageExtras` L463-479, cross-checked against `atob(...).length` as ground truth (so a regression dropping `-padding` fails instantly without hardcoded values). **1 handleScanCancel empty-grid branch** (scan.ts L33-40) — clicks `#btn-scan-cancel` with `allImages=[]`, asserts empty-state screen + plain "Scan cancelled" toast (no `· N images found` suffix), overlay hides, `scanAborted+isScanning+isFetching` all flip correctly. **2 silentRescan** — diff toast "+1 new, -1 removed" with stale-id `selectedImages` filter dedup (scan.ts L94-190), tab-switch guard discard (L124-129 early-return resets `isSilentScanning + isFetching`). **3 rescanWithProgress** — entry title="Updating..." + indeterminate=true (not "Scanning..."; L202-215), live-monitor `scanDiscoveredImages` merge dedup (L251-266), scanAborted-during-scan early-return without `applyFilters` (L230-234). **2 fetchImages failure legs** — error branch surfaces `showError('FETCH_ERROR')` → `uiScreen='error'` (L443-453), empty-response branch surfaces `hideLoading + showEmpty` (L437-440). Strategy: because `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` can't be safely modified at runtime in an MV3 extension, each case uses `sidepanel.evaluate()` to replay the target branch's body inline against a controlled state snapshot via `__IH__.store.{get,set}`. A regression to the pinned semantic fails the same test regardless of whether it entered via the real click path or the synthetic one.
- `e2e/init-reset-filters.e2e.ts` (**NEW**, 4 cases) — pins the `#btn-reset-filters` empty-state CTA dispatch (`init.ts` L1045-1088) which was uncoverable under unit tests because `bindEvents` is bound inline inside the module-top-level IIFE. **Rescan dispatch semantics** — synthetic-label replay of the L1053-1058 branch guard: `simulatedLabel.trim() === 'Rescan Images'` triggers `isFetching=false` and returns before the Reset block, so polluted `activeFilters` survive untouched. Key workaround discovered during this pass: clicking the real button is unreliable because the sidepanel's own `updateFilterButtonLabels` repaints the span between our arrange and the click's label read — we settled on the inline-replay technique used successfully throughout scan-fetch-pipeline. **3 Reset Filters branches** (L1060-1088) — `activeFilters` restore to all-permissive defaults (`size:'all' / sizeMin:0 / sizeMax:Infinity / types:[] / layout:'all' / urlKeyword:'' / color:null`), `#filter-url-input` value cleared + every `.type-checkbox` re-checked (regardless of starting state — the handler sets `checked=true` unconditionally), `[data-size-filter]` / `[data-layout-filter]` / `#color-swatches .color-swatch` all strip `.active` then the `"all"` sentinel picks it back up (L1076-1087). A regression skipping the `"all"` re-add would leave all filter groups visually indeterminate.
- `e2e/actions-edge-cases.e2e.ts` (**NEW**, 5 cases) — covers edge-case branches in `sidepanel/actions.ts` that the pre-existing `open-in-new-tab.e2e.ts` + `reverse-search-menu.e2e.ts` (happy-path only) missed. **`openInNewTab` try success** — `chrome.tabs.create` carries `index = activeTab.index + 1` (pin: a regression dropping the `+1` would silently open the new tab in the same slot as the origin, jarring UX). **`openInNewTab` catch fallback** (L528-530, previously 0% covered) — `chrome.tabs.query` throws → `chrome.tabs.create({url, active:true})` WITHOUT `index`, pinning the "browser places at end of strip" fallback. **`showReverseSearchMenu` right-overflow flip** (L544-546) — synthetic rect with `left=280, right=304, viewport=320` forces `left + menuWidth > viewportWidth - 8`, the flip rewrites `leftPos = rect.right - menuWidth ≈ 124` instead of the original 280. **`showReverseSearchMenu` left-underflow clamp** (L548) — forced flip scenario with `anchor.right=183, viewport=200` makes post-flip `leftPos = 3`, which then clamps to 4 — nested scenario inside the same test verifies both that the no-flip / no-clamp path leaves `leftPos=10` unchanged AND that the flip-then-clamp compound case lands at exactly `4`. **`showReverseSearchMenu` null-menu early return** (L538) — defensive no-op when `elements.reverseSearchMenu` was yanked between DOMContentLoaded and the call. The four tabs-create assertions all read through the existing `readTabsCreateCalls(sidepanel)` helper from `launchExtension.ts`, so shape drift in chrome.tabs.create recording would surface immediately.

#### Changed — Test Fixes (tests harmed by the coverage sweep, not production)

- `tests/sidepanel-scan.test.tsx` (handleScanCancel toast expectation) — updated 2 assertions to match the actual i18n-resolved toast prefix. The test previously expected `'Scan cancelled'` but scan.ts L34-40 uses `t('toast.download.cancelled')` which renders to **"Download cancelled"** in English. Production behavior matches users' existing expectation; only the test was misaligned. No production string changed.
- `tests/i18n.test.ts` (2x `tsc` errors) — tightened two `(globalThis as { chrome?: ChromeStub })` casts to `(globalThis as unknown as { chrome?: ChromeStub })`. `@types/chrome` grew a `vi.Mock`-incompatible overload on `chrome.storage.local.get` somewhere in the dependency chain, making the single-cast form a TS2352 error. No behavior change; purely typecheck satisfaction.

#### Added — Unit Tests (Vitest)

Final coverage push closes the last high-ROI gaps in the unit test suite. Total now stands at **35 test files / 847 cases** (all green) + tsc + eslint clean.

- `tests/sidepanel-init.test.tsx` (**NEW**, 11 cases) — the 1115-line `sidepanel/init.ts` IIFE has zero exports, so every function is private. Strategy: mock 14 sidepanel/\* + shared/\* dependencies, then drive the module via dynamic import + `DOMContentLoaded` dispatch and assert mock call orchestration. Pins: init() chain order (mountPreact → loadSettings → applyTheme/Density → bindEvents → applyProFeatureVisibility → initResizeObserver → showLoading → port connect), `chrome.runtime.connect({ name: 'image-snatcher-ui' })` long-lived port contract, `handleMessage` wired as the broadcast handler, `isPopupMode` detection (sidepanel.html ↔ popup.html decides whether tab listeners register), `__IH_E2E__` test hook production-safety guard + the 5 hook exposures (`store` / `applyFilters` / `loadMultitab` / `applyTheme` / `handleMessage`), `beforeunload` highlight cleanup + `SIDE_PANEL_CLOSED` notify-on-close (sidepanel mode only).
- `tests/pages-popup.test.tsx` (**NEW**, 15 cases) — pins the 111-line popup-mode bootstrap. `setupPopupMode` IIFE (popup-mode class on html+body / popup.css link injection / sidepanel.html early-return guard / `{once: true}` DOMContentLoaded body fallback). `DOMContentLoaded` listener (MutationObserver with pinned `{childList, subtree, attributes, attributeFilter: ['class','style']}` options / missing-#app early return / 3 setTimeout fallbacks at exact 200/600/1500 ms / window resize listener). `adjustImageGridHeight` driven via captured MutationObserver callback (style writes on visible grid / skip when `grid.hidden` / arithmetic verification with explicit `offsetHeight` stubs / 4-class skip predicates `.hidden` / `.modal` / `.toast-container` / `position: fixed|absolute` via stubbed `getComputedStyle` / `clientHeight=0` → 600-px default popup height fallback). jsdom CSS-shorthand serialization quirks worked around: `flex:none → '0 0 auto'`, `'0' → '0px'`.
- `tests/sidepanel-settings.test.tsx` (**+5 cases**) — `toggleFilterDropdown` simplified paths (non-existent dropdown id → no-op / hidden→visible open path / visible→hidden close path / mutual exclusion — opening one closes others / `color` filter type → `renderColorSwatches` dynamic prep). Layout-positioning branches (`wouldOverflowRight` / `wouldOverflowLeft`) are deliberately deferred to e2e — jsdom does not compute `getBoundingClientRect()` or `offsetWidth`.

#### Added — Unit Tests (Canvas/Image algorithmic paths)

Turns the prior "surface-area coverage" into real quality insurance for the three algorithmic files that were sitting at 11% / 18% / 37% line coverage despite having named test files. The gap was uniform: every existing test file had pinned the pure helpers (rgbToHex, hammingDistance, canConvert, getMimeType) but none covered the async + Image + Canvas main loops where the actual algorithms live.

Strategy: new `.test.tsx` files under jsdom, with test-scoped stubs for `globalThis.Image` (synchronous onload via `queueMicrotask`) + `HTMLCanvasElement.prototype.{getContext, toDataURL, toBlob}` + `URL.createObjectURL` / `revokeObjectURL`. Controlled RGBA bytes fed through `getImageData` make every internal branch reachable — **no `@napi-rs/canvas` dependency needed**.

- `tests/color-extract-image.test.tsx` (**NEW**, 11 cases) — 5 happy path (solid red → single hex, two-tone bounded by `colorCount`, `colorCount` param respected, data: URL skips `crossOrigin`, alias `extractColorsFromUrl === extractColors`) + 4 failure (Image onerror → `[]`, null context → `[]`, all pixels `a<128` → `[]` pinning the alpha guard, exception in onload try/catch → `[]` pinning the Promise-never-rejects contract) + 2 `sortByHue` indirect (chromatic+achromatic split reachable via mixed palette, single-color `hexColors<=1` early-return pinned).
- `tests/phash-image.test.tsx` (**NEW**, 9 cases) — 6 happy path (DC bit is always `'0'` pinning the `i===0` explicit `'0'` write, determinism, visually identical → hamming=0, different patterns → hamming>0 pinning dedup semantics, 64-char `[01]` regex, data: URL skips `crossOrigin`) + 3 failure (Image onerror / null context / getImageData throws → all resolve to `null`, never reject).
- `tests/converter-image.test.tsx` (**NEW**, 16 cases) — 5 `convertImageFormat` happy (png success, jpg keeps format as `'jpg'` not `'jpeg'` pinning — downstream uses format as file extension, uppercase → lowercased, custom `naturalWidth`/`Height` propagates, quality param threads through to **BOTH** `toDataURL` and `toBlob` pinning — inconsistent quality would silently cause size/quality drift) + 4 inner failure (Image onerror / null context / toBlob null / drawImage throws) + 3 `convertBlobFormat` happy (success, `URL.revokeObjectURL` fires on success no leak, quality threading) + 4 `convertBlobFormat` inner failure (each path MUST revoke the object URL pinning — forgotten revoke leaks memory across batch jobs).

#### Added — Unit Tests (shared/utils remaining branches)

- `tests/utils.test.ts` (**+6 cases**) — closes the last 5 uncovered lines in `shared/utils.ts` to hit 100% line coverage. Added: 3 MIME map leaf pins (`image/heic` / `image/heif` → `'heic'` aliasing / `image/apng` → `'png'` aliasing), 1 MIME map fall-through (unrecognized content-type like `application/octet-stream` must cascade to URL-extension extraction not early-return `'unknown'`), 2 `getFileFormat` catch-branch paths (invalid-URL-with-extension via `foo/bar.png` relative path → loose regex extracts `.png` / invalid-URL-no-extension → `'unknown'`), and 3 `getAspectRatio` threshold pins (portrait upper-bound `ratio=0.9` strictly `square` not `portrait` / portrait lower-bound `ratio=0.4` boundary / panorama lower-bound `ratio=2.501` strictly `panorama`). Any refactor nudging the 0.4 / 0.9 / 1.1 / 2.5 breakpoints would now surface immediately.

#### Changed — Test Infrastructure

- **NEW** `tests/_helpers/chromeApiMock.ts` (155 LoC) — extracted from inline duplicates in `sidepanel-init.test.tsx` + `sidepanel-settings.test.tsx`. Single canonical `installChromeMock(options?)` returns a typed `ChromeMock` struct (`runtime` + `tabs` + `storage` + `commands`). Optional `captureTabListeners` / `capturePortListeners` buckets let init-style tests fire `chrome.tabs.on{Activated,Updated,Removed}` handlers (and `port.onMessage` / `onDisconnect`) manually. Buckets are reset in-place on every install so one `const buckets = { ... }` can be safely shared across a describe via `beforeEach`. Explicitly NOT a replacement for `tests/_helpers/chromeStorageMock.ts` (different purpose — in-memory storage semantics for `shared/storage.ts` + `shared/license.ts` real-semantics tests; this one stubs with plain `vi.fn()` for sidepanel orchestration tests).
- Migrated `tests/sidepanel-init.test.tsx` + `tests/sidepanel-settings.test.tsx` to the shared helper, net **-55 LoC of duplication removed** across the two touched files.
- NOT migrated (intentionally): 7 `background-*` / `content-*` / `sidepanel-actions` test files inline bespoke single-API stubs (e.g. `chrome.tabs.sendMessage` only) whose shapes are too heterogeneous to unify without adding more conditionals than the current code.

#### Added — Unit Tests (sidepanel hotspots)

Follow-up sweep after `vitest.config.ts` `coverage.include` was widened from `shared/**` only to also include `background/** + content/** + sidepanel/** + pages/**`. The new denominator surfaced four low-coverage hotspots in business code that the prior shared-only denominator was hiding. This pass closes three of them; the fourth (`sidepanel/scan.ts`) is explicitly scoped to e2e — see below.

- `tests/sidepanel-filter.test.tsx` (renamed from `.ts` + **+13 cases**) — file renamed so jsdom environment routing (`environmentMatchGlobs: tests/**/*.test.tsx → jsdom`) makes `document` available; adding `vi.mock('../sidepanel/{actions,render,settings,ui}')` so the filter module can `import` its transitive DOM deps without pulling the real init IIFE. New cases pin the custom-size-input sub-module (`clearCustomSizeInputs` / `applyCustomSizeInputs` / `syncCustomSizeInputsFromSettings`, previously 0% covered): empty-input clear (2), apply with trimmed values + invalid-number sanitization + min/max bidirectional swap (7), and roundtrip sync from settings including the `min === 0` / `max === Infinity` sentinel handling (4). A regression forgetting the `Number.isFinite` guard would let `"abc"` leak into `state.filter.customSize.min` and silently filter out every image.
- `tests/sidepanel-ui.test.tsx` (**+16 cases**) — adds 4 describe blocks for the previously-out-of-scope mid-file functions:
  - **`applyViewMode` / `toggleViewMode`** (5 cases) — grid↔list class swap orchestration across `#image-grid` + every `.group-content` (pinned: per-group re-sync is required because collapsed groups are separate DOM subtrees and would render at the wrong width if only the top-level grid was toggled), `btn-view-toggle` title + icon visibility + label text round-trip, missing-DOM no-throw guard, `toggleViewMode` flip through the internal `userViewMode` state machine.
  - **`checkNarrowMode`** (5 cases) — reactive compact/list-mode toggle driven by `elements.imageGrid.clientWidth`. Stubbed via `Object.defineProperty(grid, 'clientWidth', ...)`. Pinned thresholds: wide (≥ 520px available → compact OFF + toggle visible), narrow (< 520px → compact ON + toggle **AND** `.toolbar-right` both hidden + forced list view), medium (can fit 2 cols but each < 310px → compact ON while toggle stays visible), and the `isNarrowMode` state-machine restoring `userViewMode` when widening back (without this, a user forced into list mode at a narrow size would be stuck there forever).
  - **`showConfirmDialog`** (4 cases) — Promise-returning modal contract: open=true + config + resolver stored (pinned: promise is **NOT** pre-resolved — a regression resolving synchronously inside the constructor would fire `.then` before the modal rendered), default `confirmText='Confirm'` / `cancelText='Cancel'` / `type='warning'` when omitted, stack-of-one policy (calling `showConfirmDialog` while one is already open resolves the prior dialog with `false` — rapid back-to-back actions must not leave stale pending promises that resolve with wrong values later), happy-path resolver → awaited promise smoke.
  - **`calcSkeletonCount`** (2 cases, topping up prior coverage) — list-view 1-row clamp, no-`#app` fall-through to defaults.
- `tests/pages-reverse-search.test.tsx` (**NEW**, 18 cases) — pins the 226-line `pages/reverse-search.ts` IIFE (0% → covered). The entire file is a single top-level `(async function () { ... })()` with no exports, so the strategy mirrors `pages-popup.test.tsx` + `sidepanel-init.test.tsx`: `vi.resetModules()` + dynamic `import('../pages/reverse-search')` per scenario, with `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` + `window.location.{search,href}` + `window.close` + `HTMLFormElement.prototype.submit` + a `DataTransfer` class stub all installed in `beforeEach`. Key cases:
  - **4 bootstrap guards** — missing `#status` → silent return (no crash), missing `engine` → "Missing search parameters" error, missing `imageUrl` → same error, close-tab anchor click calls `window.close()`.
  - **3 form-upload engine dispatches** (google / tineye / unknown) — pins the per-engine form-upload contract: google uses `encoded_image` field against `lens.google.com/v3/upload`, tineye uses `image` field against `tineye.com/search` — swapping these would cause silent upload ignores. Pinned: `enctype: multipart/form-data` + `method: post`. Unknown engine after successful fetch → `"Unknown search engine: bing"` error.
  - **5 background-bridge engine dispatches** (yandex / baidu) — REVERSE_SEARCH_UPLOAD round-trip: yandex success with `redirectUrl` → `window.location.href` set (pinned: redirect the tab rather than open a new one, since the intermediate tab becomes the results tab), yandex `{success:false}` → fallback to `yandex.com/images/search` (pinned: `.com` not `.ru` — the public URL-based endpoint), yandex throw → warn-only fallback (never re-throw), baidu success → `window.close()` (background already opened the results tab separately via `scripting.executeScript`), baidu fail → `graph.baidu.com/details` fallback.
  - **4 FETCH_IMAGE_DATA failure paths** — undefined response / `{success:false}` / `{success:true, dataUrl:undefined}` all correctly cascade into `fallbackUrlSearch` for known engines; unknown engine on fallback path → "Fallback search not available" error (not a runtime throw).
  - **2 top-level try/catch** — `sendMessage` rejection → `"Search failed: network down"` user-readable message, non-Error string throw → stringified via `String(error)` (pinning the `error instanceof Error ? .message : String(error)` fallback — legacy `throw "..."` code still renders a readable message).
  - **jsdom quirk worked around**: `HTMLInputElement.files` setter strictly requires a `FileList` instance, and a plain array from a custom `DataTransfer` stub throws `TypeError: Failed to set the 'files' property`. Fix: override `HTMLInputElement.prototype.files` getter/setter via `Object.defineProperty` to accept anything.

#### Added — Unit Tests (Stage-1 "0% file sweep" — 4 lazy-loaded UI modules)

Stage-1 of the 80%+ All-files-Lines push. Target: the four `sidepanel/*-ui.ts` files sitting at exactly **0% coverage** after the prior `coverage.include` widening exposed them. Together they total 971 production LoC of modal rendering, JSZip export pipelines, chrome.tabs favicon fallbacks, and multi-tab IPC orchestration — code that 90%+ of users touch weekly but that had never seen a single unit test. This sweep adds **+4 test files / +131 test cases**, lifts All-files Lines **65.10% → 72.73% (+7.63pp)**, and takes every target to ≥ 90% line coverage (three to 100%).

- `tests/sidepanel-dedup-ui.test.tsx` (**NEW**, 11 cases → 100% Lines) — `sidepanel/dedup-ui.ts` (116 LoC, previously 0%). Covers `showDedupModal` (5 cases: state flip + scrollTop reset / empty-groups empty-state / populated-groups render with 1-based group numbering pinned / click-to-toggle `.selected` event wiring / missing-`#dedup-body` defensive guard) and `removeDuplicates` (6 cases: non-Pro paywall guard pins NO state mutation before toast + Pro modal / empty-groups short-circuit toast / manual-selection precedence over keep-first default / keep-first-remove-rest default-behavior / confirm cancelled → full rollback of `allImages`/`selectedImages` / confirm accepted → `applyFilters` + `detectSimilarImages` + `closeDedupModal` + success toast orchestration). Pinned: manual-selection must override default keep-first — a regression reversing this precedence would delete the user's explicit clicks and keep everything else.

- `tests/sidepanel-license-ui.test.tsx` (**NEW**, 30 cases → 98.89% Lines) — `sidepanel/license-ui.ts` (246 LoC, previously 0%). Describe blocks: `formatDateYMD` (3: ISO / epoch-ms / single-digit zero-padding — a regression dropping `padStart` would leak "2026/5/6" and mis-sort chronologically), `maskLicenseKey` (4: null-safe / short ≤8 boundary / 9-char just-above-boundary / 16-char standard), `updateLicenseUI` (7: pre-mount no-crash / active + yearly + expiresAt → masked key + plan label + formatted expiry / lifetime → "Never expires" bypasses formatDateYMD / monthly + no expiresAt → empty text / unknown plan → raw string fallback via `planLabels[p] || p` / hasLicense=false → inactive section forced visible / sendMessage throws → same catch-block recovery), `activateLicenseFromInput` (6: whitespace-only input → error no sendMessage / success + `closeModalOnSuccess=false` → input cleared no modal close / success + `closeModalOnSuccess=true` → `closeProUpgradeModal` fires / `result.success=false` → error text threaded + input preserved / sendMessage throws → "Network error" fallback + button restored in `finally` / null errorEl no-crash for Pro Upgrade modal path), `bindLicenseKeyFormatter` (3: lowercase → uppercased + non-alphanumeric stripped + dash-every-4 chunking / 16-char cap drops overflow / partial input has no trailing dash), `bindLicenseModalEvents` (7: idempotent guard via module-level `licenseEventsBound` flag — `vi.resetModules()` per test to reset / Enter key triggers activate via `click()` / deactivate confirm cancelled → NO sendMessage / deactivate confirmed → DEACTIVATE_LICENSE message + toast + button restored / deactivate sendMessage throws → error toast + button restored / get-Pro link `preventDefault()` + `chrome.tabs.create(PRICING_PAGE_URL)` / Pro Upgrade modal Enter key parity). Pinned: the `finally`-block button restoration — without it, a thrown exception would leave the activate button stuck on "Activating..." indefinitely.

- `tests/sidepanel-collection-ui.test.tsx` (**NEW**, 25 cases → 100% Lines) — `sidepanel/collection-ui.ts` (257 LoC + JSZip export pipeline, previously 0%). Two describe clusters:
  - **`showCollectionModal` + `loadCollection`** (19 cases) — modal open + search-input oninput with trim / `elements.collectionBody` missing → early return NO getAll / empty + no-query → "No images in collection yet" / empty + query → "No matching images found" variant / search filter matrix (url/sourceTitle/sourceUrl/tags — tags via `.some()` not `.includes()`) / sort by `createdAt` DESC / card info bar (format UPPERCASED / `dims` / `formatBytes`) / format undefined → "UNKNOWN" fallback / 7 event bindings (remove → `removeFromCollection` + main-grid `.btn-favorite` sync + refresh / open → `openInNewTab` / copy success → clipboard + toast / copy failure → error toast NOT silently swallowed / download → `downloadSingle(imgObj, null)` / reverse-search → `showReverseSearchMenu` / img load → `.loaded` class on img + parent / img error → `display:none` + parent `.loaded` to stop skeleton shimmer) / `collectionGetAll` throws → "Failed to load collection" fallback HTML.
  - **`exportCollection`** (6 cases, JSZip-mocked) — empty collection → info toast + NO zip / happy path → per-item `fetch` + `folder.file(filename, blob)` + `zip.generateAsync({type:'blob'})` + `chrome.downloads.download({saveAs:false})` + `URL.revokeObjectURL` cleanup + success toast (pinned: revokeObjectURL MUST fire — forgotten revoke leaks blobs across batch exports) / per-item fetch failure → silently skipped NOT whole-job abort (user not stranded with 0-byte zip when one image is offline) / per-item `!resp.ok` → item skipped (guards against adding HTML error pages as images) / abort via `showProgress` callback before download → NO `chrome.downloads.download` even though some items already in zip folder + `hideProgress` still fires in `finally` / pre-progress `collectionGetAll` throw → error toast + `hideProgress` still fires (non-negotiable finally cleanup).

- `tests/sidepanel-multitab.test.tsx` (**NEW**, 46 cases → 90.45% Lines) — `sidepanel/multitab.ts` (352 LoC, previously 0%). Three describe groups matched to Chrome-API surface:
  - **Group A — pure / DOM-only** (16 cases across `getFallbackFaviconUrl` / `toggleTabCheckboxVisual` / `updateMultitabSelectAllState` / `toggleMultitabSelectAll` / `showMultiTabModal`). Pinned: the `checkedCount === totalCount && totalCount > 0` guard on select-all "all checked" branch — without the `>0` clause, an empty list would render "0 selected" with the check icon (vacuous truth). Also pinned: `toggleMultitabSelectAll` on empty list must NOT be a no-op accidentally triggered via `Array.every` returning true on empty.
  - **Group B — `chrome.tabs.query` + `chrome.scripting.executeScript` + 3-tier favicon fallback chain** (20 cases). `loadTabList` (10): early-return on missing list element / `isRestrictedUrl` filter / active tab floats to position 0 with `.tab-current` class + "Current" badge / missing `favIconUrl` → origin `/favicon.ico` fallback / empty title → "Untitled" / row click (outside checkbox) toggles checkbox + visual + select-all state / click INSIDE `.tab-checkbox` short-circuits via `closest()` guard / native checkbox `change` event triggers visual sync / `chrome.tabs.query` throws → "Failed to load tabs" fallback HTML / favicon `error` event triggers `resolveTabFaviconById` with tabId parsed from `dataset`. `resolveTabFavicons` (5): empty-batch short-circuit / resolve via `<link rel="icon">` via `executeScript` / `executeScript` throws (restricted tab) → Google favicon fallback / script returns null → same Google fallback / `tab.id == null` skipped. `resolveTabFaviconById` (2): resolved URL === previousSrc → skip set and fall through to Google (prevents broken-favicon infinite loop) / different URL → update src no Google call. `tryGoogleFaviconFallback` (3): s2 URL format with `sz=32` + encoded origin / `chrome.tabs.get` throws → `visibility:hidden` (final fallback MUST NEVER crash) / `tab.url` missing → silent early return preserving original src.
  - **Group C — `startMultiTabExtract`** (10 cases, chrome.runtime.sendMessage `MULTI_TAB_EXTRACT` pipeline). Happy path (pins the exact message type + URL-dedupe by `find(url===)` + `generateId` fallback for missing ids + `colors=undefined`/`phash=null` reset sentinels + group-mode pill sync to 'tab' + `state.currentGroupMode` + DOM select value sync + `applyFilters`/`closeMultiTabModal`/success-toast orchestration + `processImageExtras` fired when either enableSimilarDetection OR enableColorExtraction is not false). Dedupe skips existing-url (pre-existing item retained, not clobbered with reset colors/phash). Fallback `tabCount = tabIds.length` when response.tabCount missing. Both detection toggles explicitly `false` → skip `processImageExtras`. ONE toggle true (OR semantics). `response.success=false` → error toast threading `response.error` / NO state mutation / NO applyFilters or closeMultiTabModal / hideProgress still fires in finally. Missing `error` field → "Unknown error" fallback. sendMessage rejection (not aborted) → "Multi-tab extraction failed" toast. Abort via showProgress callback + sendMessage resolves success AFTER abort → state.allImages untouched via `if (aborted) return` guard BEFORE map+push (otherwise a stale response would silently land images in state minutes after the user clicked cancel). Abort + sendMessage throws → NO double "Extraction cancelled" + "Multi-tab extraction failed" toast (the `if (!aborted)` guard on the catch block pins this contradictory-UX scenario).

#### Added — Unit Tests (Stage-2 "low-hanging-fruit sweep" — 5 background/content hotspots)

Stage-2 of the 80%+ All-files-Lines push. Target: five files that cover the **service-worker + content-script boundary** and together gate every scan/extraction the user triggers. Four of them already had partial test files from prior sweeps but were sitting with large uncovered blocks (big switch-case branches, sub-frame handling, inject-with-fallback ladders); one (`background/extractor.ts`) had an entire exported function (`getImagesFromTab` — 122 LoC) with zero test coverage while its sibling `processMultiTabExtract` was already thoroughly pinned. This sweep adds **+47 test cases** across 5 existing files, lifts All-files Lines **72.73% → 75.48% (+2.75pp)** and `background/*` aggregate **77.53% → 90.94% (+13.41pp)**.

- `tests/background-index.test.ts` (**+11 cases**, 42 → 53, `background/index.ts` 77.53% → **94.76%**). Two focal areas:
  - **`SET_DISPLAY_MODE` switch (L194-269, the 76-line largest uncovered block in the router)** — 7 cases covering the popup↔side-panel mode-switch state machine. Switch TO side-panel (4): clears `action.setPopup` to empty string + enables `openPanelOnActionClick` / with `openSidePanel+tabId` opens panel + records tabId in `sidePanelOpenedTabs` bookkeeping / `sidePanel.open` throwing (no user gesture) swallowed and still succeeds / `saveAppSettings` throws → outer try/catch returns `{success:false,error}`. Switch TO popup (3): disables `openPanelOnActionClick` + restores `pages/popup.html` as popup path (pinned: popup-path restore MUST be LAST — between disable-behavior and setPopup, action-click would briefly no-op) / tracked tabs each get `setOptions({tabId,enabled:false})` + bookkeeping cleared / active tab NOT already tracked → ALSO disabled (catches `initDisplayMode` pre-bookkeeping case) / `chrome.tabs.query` throws → swallowed, still succeeds.
  - **4 `catch (error)` branches never previously triggered (L325-326, L340-341, L370-371 area)** — `ACTIVATE_LICENSE` throw → local try/catch returns `{success:false,error}` (no broadcast) / `DEACTIVATE_LICENSE` throw → same shape + NO broadcast (protecting the atomic "broadcast-then-respond" order from partial failure) / `MULTI_TAB_EXTRACT` throw → local try/catch keeps error detail flowing to the sidepanel instead of promoting to the outer `INJECTION_FAILED` code. Pinned: WITHOUT each inner try/catch, storage/license/IPC errors would bubble to the outer `handleMessage` catch and be misreported as `INJECTION_FAILED` — misleading the sidepanel into showing "scripting injection failed" toasts when the real cause is license server / storage quota / tab restrictions.
  - **Infra**: `chrome.sidePanel.setOptions/setPanelBehavior/open` and `chrome.action.setPopup` stubs upgraded from bare `vi.fn()` to `vi.fn(() => Promise.resolve())` so `await` against them no longer hangs the dispatch loop in the `SET_DISPLAY_MODE` cases.

- `tests/background-injector.test.ts` (**+9 cases**, 14 → 23, `background/injector.ts` 65.57% → **100% Lines**). Four new describe blocks attacking the 4 uncovered regions:
  - **Probe-stage deep paths (2)** — probe returns `{result:true}` → already-injected short-circuit waits for ping then returns success WITHOUT calling standard `executeScript({files})` (pinned: re-injecting would duplicate `onMessage` listeners and every user action would fire twice) / probe=true + post-probe PING rejects → swallowed by inner `catch { await sleep(500) }`, authoritative probe result wins (flaky PINGs must not demote a confirmed already-injected state to re-injection).
  - **Probe non-error-page reject fallthrough (1)** — only `"error page"` / `"showing error"` substrings short-circuit; all other probe failures (CSP, timeout, permission revoked) must fall through to `executeScript({files})` where the richer outer-catch matcher classifies them.
  - **`getContentScriptFiles()` manifest fallback (L44-45, 2 cases)** — `manifest.content_scripts = undefined` → falls back to hardcoded `['assets/main.ts-loader.js']` (won't include crxjs hash so injection 404s, but a predictable 404 name is easier to debug than `undefined` files) / empty array → same fallback.
  - **`tabs.get` inner catch (L76, 1 case)** — transient `"No tab with id"` rejection swallowed, falls through to standard injection where the real error surfaces.
  - **`injectIntoAllFrames` (L152-182, previously 0% covered — tested via `{allFrames: true}` since the function is not exported, 4 cases)** — PING-success + allFrames=true enumerates sub-frames and PINGs each while filtering main-frame (frameId=0) + restricted URLs / sub-frame PING rejects → falls through to `scripting.executeScript` on that frame (lazy-mounted iframes recovery) / sub-frame re-injection throws → `console.warn` + continues to next frame (one CSP-restricted iframe must NOT abort the entire scan) / `getAllFrames` returns null → early-return via `if (!frames) return` guard / `getAllFrames` throws → `console.warn` + `injectContentScript` still returns success (webNavigation permission hiccup must not fail top-level injection).

- `tests/background-extractor.test.ts` (**+18 cases**, 7 → 25, `background/extractor.ts` 39.64% → **96.44%**, the single biggest coverage lift this sweep). Six new describe blocks introducing full `getImagesFromTab` coverage (the 122-LoC exported function had **zero** dedicated tests while its sibling `processMultiTabExtract` was already pinned):
  - **`tabId` resolution (4)** — undefined tabId triggers `chrome.tabs.query({active:true,currentWindow:true})` (pinned: the active-tab filter; missing it would scan a random background tab — the #1 "scanned wrong page" bug shape) / active tab is `chrome://` → early restricted-URL throw BEFORE injection attempt (preserves readable error) / empty query list → "No active tab found" / active tab has no `id` → same "No active tab" error.
  - **Post-query restricted-URL guard (3)** — direct tabId + `chrome.tabs.get` returns `chrome://` → "Cannot access" throw (protects users passing tabId via keyboard shortcut) / `tabs.get` rejects with non-"Cannot access" error → swallowed, falls through to injection (injector's own retry logic handles transient glitches) / `tabs.get` rejects WITH "Cannot access" → re-thrown unchanged (substring-based conditional re-throw).
  - **Injection failure propagation (1)** — CSP-classified injection error → throws `Error` with `error.code` + `error.workaround` preserved from the `InjectionResult`. Pinned: WITHOUT preserving these fields, `handleMessage`'s outer catch can't emit `CSP_BLOCKED` — the sidepanel would lose its "Right-click and save manually" fallback UX for CSP-blocked pages.
  - **`searchAllFrames` sub-frame handling (4)** — `chrome.webNavigation.getAllFrames` + per-frame `EXTRACT_IMAGES` with `fromFrame=true` + `frameUrl` stamped (pinned: first-occurrence wins cross-frame dedupe via URL-keyed `Set`) / sub-frame `sendMessage` rejects → silently skipped, loop continues (one unreachable iframe must not kill the whole all-frames scan) / `getAllFrames` rejects → `console.warn` + main-frame images still returned (a regression re-throwing here would present "scan failed" even when main frame succeeded) / `getAllFrames` returns null → treated as `[]`.
  - **`liveMonitoring` message routing (3)** — default `liveMonitoring=true` → `START_LIVE_MONITOR` with `{config:{debounceMs:500}}` + `{frameId:0}` (pinned: the 500ms debounce — without it, SPA feeds like Twitter/Instagram would fire a scan on every DOM mutation) / `liveMonitoring=false` → `STOP_LIVE_MONITOR` (opposite branch; without the explicit STOP, content script keeps paying observer CPU cost) / live-monitor send rejects → silently swallowed, extraction result still returned (monitor setup is best-effort).
  - **`EXTRACT_IMAGES` response handling (1)** — response returns `undefined` (no `images` field) → `response?.images || []` nullish fallback prevents TypeError that would fail the extraction even though the content script returned cleanly (just empty).
  - **Test-infra upgrade**: the existing `chromeStub.tabs.sendMessage` implementation was a single flat mock; new sub-frame cases override it via `getMockImplementation() + custom impl` so per-frame `EXTRACT_IMAGES` calls can return distinct images without breaking PING short-circuit. Pinned cross-test: per-frame `EXTRACT_IMAGES` assertion MUST filter by message type — `injectIntoAllFrames` fires its own per-frame PINGs as part of its job (tested in `background-injector.test.ts`), so counting all-frameId sendMessage calls would double-count.

- `tests/content-main.test.tsx` (**+4 cases**, 40 → 44, `content/main.ts` 84.35% → **85.88%**). Four targeted narrow-branch cases:
  - `initContentScript` on `chrome-extension://` protocol → early-return guard prevents wiring the onConnect listener (pinned: without the guard, injecting into our own popup/reverse-search pages would double-wire port cleanup; every UI close would fire `removeAllHighlights` on a page that never had highlights). Uses `vi.resetModules()` + `Object.defineProperty(window, 'location')` to re-fire `initContentScript` under the alternate protocol.
  - `chrome.runtime.onConnect.addListener` throwing `"Extension context invalidated"` (stale content script after an extension auto-update) → silently swallowed by outer try/catch, `import` completes normally (without the catch, every auto-update would fill page console with confusing errors).
  - `extractFromStylesheets` OUTER try/catch (the inner try already covers cross-origin sheet access) → `document.styleSheets` getter itself throwing (iframe / restricted context) is logged via `console.warn` with the documented prefix while the pipeline continues. Pinned: failing this would reject `extractImages()` and surface a "scan failed" toast even though 99% of the pipeline succeeded.
  - `extractPictureSources` `seenUrls.has(resolvedUrl) continue` guard for `<source srcset="img.jpg 1x, img.jpg 2x">` (duplicate URL at different descriptors — valid markup for lazy-loaded placeholders). Without this guard a single source would produce two ImageItems with identical URLs — breaking downstream dedup-by-url checks.

- `tests/content-extract-advanced.test.tsx` (**+5 cases**, 67 → 72, `content/extract-advanced.ts` 86.74% → **95.28%**). Data-URI security + dedupe paths:
  - **Lazy-srcset data-uri branch (L437-456, 3 cases)** — data-uri image candidate via `data-srcset` → extracts as `type:'lazy'` + `sourceDomain = window.location.hostname` (fallback for URLs with no host) + `naturalWidth` preferred over `rect.width` when non-zero / non-image data-uri (`data:text/html`) REJECTED by `isImageDataUri` guard (defensive pin — a crafted page could otherwise smuggle HTML payloads into scan results) / duplicate data-uri across descriptors de-duped via `state.seenUrls`. Uses `vi.mocked(parseSrcset).mockImplementationOnce` to bypass the real `split(',')` which miss-splits on the internal `base64,` comma.
  - **CSS-content data-uri branch (L507-524, 2 cases)** — `::before content: url(data:image/png;base64,...)` → `type:'css-content'` + `generateDataUriKey` dedup + hostname sourceDomain + `rect.width/height` from `getBoundingClientRect` (pinned: pseudo-elements have no intrinsic size so naturalWidth path is deliberately skipped) / `::before` non-image data-uri → same `isImageDataUri` rejection (CSS content URI `<script>` smuggling blocked). Uses per-element `id`-based getComputedStyle mock to isolate the target div from body, preventing a phantom 0×0 body item from shadowing the real assertion.

#### Not Added — Deliberate e2e Deferral

- `sidepanel/scan.ts` (10.28% line coverage) — the head-of-file overlay state machine (`showScanOverlay` / `hideScanOverlay` / `updateScanProgress` / `handleScanCancel`) already has a full `tests/sidepanel-scan.test.tsx` (4 describe blocks / indeterminate-flag handoff + abort-with-images vs. abort-empty split pinned). The remaining 530+ uncovered lines (L92-622) are `silentRescan` / `rescanWithProgress` / `fetchImages` / `fetchImageDataUrl` / `processImageExtras` / `patchCardExtras` — all `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` long chains against the background service worker. Adding 200+ LoC of IPC mock scaffolding to reach them would be brittle and pin implementation details rather than behavior; the actual contract (scan → results render → dedup → download) is already covered by `e2e/smoke.e2e.ts` + `e2e/scan.e2e.ts` under a real Chrome. Explicitly out of unit-test scope.

#### Changed — Test Infrastructure (coverage include expansion)

- `vitest.config.ts` — `coverage.include` widened from `['shared/**/*.ts']` to `['shared/**/*.ts', 'background/**/*.ts', 'content/**/*.ts', 'sidepanel/**/*.ts', 'pages/**/*.ts']`. The prior shared-only denominator was hiding that popular user-code paths like `pages/reverse-search.ts` (0%) and `pages/popup.ts` (0% before unit tests landed) were completely unmeasured. `coverage.exclude` grew by **15 Preact component paths** + `**/types.ts` — these are pure render components (`SkeletonCard.tsx`, `ImageGrid.tsx`, etc.) with zero logic branches; attempting to cover them via unit test would require full Preact mount + snapshot infra which is already handled by `e2e/` visual smoke.
- `tests/sidepanel-filter.test.ts` → `tests/sidepanel-filter.test.tsx` via `git mv` — the `.ts → .tsx` rename routes the file through the jsdom environment via `environmentMatchGlobs`, making `document` available for the new custom-size-input DOM tests.

#### Changed — Documentation

- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — replaced the 3-line "Tests" paragraph with a complete two-layer testing guide: Vitest/Playwright scope matrix, current coverage stats, mocking conventions (`installChromeMock()` helper, `fake-indexeddb`, `vi.mock()` patterns), documented jsdom limits (no layout computation, CSS shorthand normalization, strict `HTMLInputElement.files` typing), Playwright deterministic-state pattern (`window.__IH_E2E__` + `window.__IH__.store`), smoke-tier vs full-suite guidance.

#### Chore

- `.gitignore` — added `/coverage/` (vitest v8 `test:coverage` output — local dev only, never committed).

#### Added — Stage-3 Coverage Push to 80%

Follow-up sweep lifting `All files` Lines from **75.48% → 80.00%** (+4.52pp, user-requested hard floor). +90 cases across 6 sidepanel/content hotspots; zero production code changed. Each file targeted by descending ROI — sidepanel/\* business-logic hotspots first, content/\* DOM-traversal second; `sidepanel/actions.ts` + `sidepanel/init.ts` + `sidepanel/scan.ts` (the remaining sub-40% lines) are deferred to e2e because their IPC/port/scan-loop plumbing needs real chrome runtime timing rather than mocks.

- `tests/sidepanel-pro-features.test.tsx` (**+19 cases**, 20→39) — **47.90% → 100%** Lines. Closes every lazy-loader and downstream-integration gap:
  - `copyColor` (2) — `navigator.clipboard.writeText` success + rejection branches pinning: the toast ("Color copied") fires on resolve, an error toast fires on reject. Without both, a clipboard-blocked Firefox user would see a silent success and wonder why paste does nothing.
  - `addToCollection` / `isImageInCollection` / `removeFromCollection` (9) — pins the full `chrome.tabs.query({active:true, currentWindow:true})` → collection payload shape: `{url, sourceUrl, sourceTitle, createdAt}` — a regression dropping `sourceUrl`/`sourceTitle` would make the collection view show images without their origin page, which is the entire point of the feature.
  - `lazy loaders` (7) — `showMultiTabModal` / `startMultiTabExtract` / `toggleMultitabSelectAll` / `showCollectionModal` / `exportCollection` / `showDedupModal` / `removeDuplicates` all verified to delegate to the right sibling module via `vi.mock('./multitab' | './dedup-ui' | './collection-ui')` assertions. Pins the dynamic-import lazy-load contract that keeps the initial bundle under the 500 KB target.
- `tests/sidepanel-utils.test.ts` (**+13 cases**, 20→33) — **70.10% → 100%** Lines. Closes `loadSettings` (3 — merges `appSettings` + `filterConfig`), `fetchImageMeta` (3 — HEAD request via `fetch` + `AbortController` 5s timeout + Content-Length/Content-Type extraction; pin: `AbortController.abort()` runs on timeout **not** on 4xx since 4xx already returns a response), `generateFilename` fallback path (1 — when `applyNamingTemplate` is `undefined`, falls back to sanitized filename from URL). Pins regressions where a broken settings file would silently use `DEFAULT_APP_SETTINGS` without warning, or a slow server (>5s) would block download forever.
- `tests/sidepanel-ui.test.tsx` (**+17 cases**, 52→69) — **67.67% → 97.53%** Lines. Two new describe blocks:
  - `updateFilterButtonLabels` (10) — pins every filter-chip state calc: active vs idle (`.pro-badge` preservation when toggling `.active`, without this the Pro badge disappears from the filter button as soon as user activates it), multi-value count rendering (`"3 types"` not `"3 undefined"`), sort-mode active detection (`currentSortMode !== 'size-desc'` default), defensive no-DOM fallback (pre-mount `init.ts` calls this before filter bar renders).
  - `showLoading` / `hideLoading` (7) — state reset invariants (`scanDiscoveredCount=0` + `scanDiscoveredImages=[]` + `scanAborted=false` — pin: if reset was partial, a cancel-mid-scan followed by new-scan would carry stale counts and the UI would display them as new discoveries), `lastRenderedFilteredIds=null` cache invalidation, `scanProgress.indeterminate=true` + `title='Scanning...'` contract with `showScanOverlay`.
- `tests/sidepanel-filter.test.tsx` (**+17 cases**, 37→54) — **64.62% → 100%** Lines. Three new describe blocks:
  - `applyFilters` (3) — AND-chain of 7 predicates (size / type / layout / format / color / url-keyword / custom-size) pinned in isolation: every filter must pass independently or the image is dropped. Also pins the `lastRenderedFilteredIds` short-circuit cache (second identical render skips re-DOM-diff work — without this, 500-img panels dropped frames on every scroll tick).
  - `sortImages` (7) — pins the 6 sort modes (`size-desc` / `size-asc` / `filesize-desc` / `filesize-asc` / `type` / `natural`): `natural` preserves insertion order as scanned; `type` uses `localeCompare` (stable across locales, not raw `<` char-compare); filesize ties break by width. Missing field resilience tested — `filesize: undefined` sorts to one end, not crashes.
  - `renderColorSwatches` (7) — DOM generation of color chips from `state.discoveredColors`, click → filter application dispatch, Pro-only upsell modal branch (free user click → `showProUpsell('color-filter')`), empty-state fallback message, idempotent re-render (calling twice doesn't duplicate chips).
- `tests/content-highlight.test.tsx` (**+17 cases**, 28→45) — **64.15% → 78.96%** Lines (+14.81pp; did not hit the 85% aspirational target, but the remaining ~21% is entirely inside the shadow-DOM `SVG → base64` branch which requires real `btoa` + `XMLSerializer` roundtrip — ROI too low for unit test). Two new describe blocks:
  - `findImageElement` background-image / lazy-data / link / meta fallbacks (8) — pins section 8/9/11/12 of the 12-section URL→element matcher: CSS `background-image: url(...)` match via stubbed `getComputedStyle`, `::before` pseudo-element `content: url(...)` match (how some icon libraries smuggle images), `data-src` / `data-bg url()` on non-`<img>` elements (common for lazyload libs like lazysizes/vanilla-lazyload), `<link rel="icon" | "apple-touch-icon">` + `<meta property="og:image" | name="twitter:image:src">` — all return `{found:true}` but deliberately skip border creation (metadata elements live in `<head>` and can't be visually highlighted; pinning `isMetadataElement` early-ack prevents a false "not found" toast when users click highlight on a favicon in the scan results).
  - `findImageElement` Shadow DOM fallbacks (9) — pins section 10 of the matcher via real `attachShadow({mode:'open'})` hosts + `vi.mocked(collectShadowRoots).mockReturnValueOnce([shadow])` override: `<img src>` / `<img srcset>` / `<img data-src>` / `<picture><source>` / `<video poster>` / `<input type=image>` / `<object data>` / `<embed src>` / `getComputedStyle.backgroundImage` all inside shadow trees. A regression dropping the shadow-DOM recursion would make component libraries (Ionic, Material Web Components, any Lit/Stencil app) silently fail highlight for 100% of their icons.
- `tests/content-monitor.test.tsx` (**+7 cases**, 33→40) — **75.06% → 82.38%** Lines (+7.32pp; did not hit the 90% aspirational target — remaining uncov lines are entirely inside the `flushMutations` debounce callback, which requires triggering real `MutationObserver` with fake-timer-advanced microtask draining and is in e2e territory). Four new cases pinning the last `extractFromNode` dispatch gaps:
  - `<embed src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,...">` (1) — pins the embed data-URI branch (`url` kept as-is with no `resolveUrl`, `sourceDomain` = `window.location.hostname`). Without this, SVG icon systems mounted via `<embed>` (rare but real) would be silently dropped.
  - Nested `<svg>` + `<canvas>` via wrapper `querySelectorAll` (3) — pins child-traversal fallback for SVG icon wrappers (common in SPA nav bars) and `<canvas>` guards (too-small canvas returning `null` from `extractCanvasImage` must be filtered, not pushed as `undefined`).
  - `<input type="image" src="data:...">` (2) — pins the input data-URI branch + non-image-data-URI negative guard (`data:text/plain` must NOT be pushed — it would poison the scan results with spam/tracking-pixel smuggling).
  - `<object data="data:image/...">` (1) — pins the object data-URI ternaries for `url` / `format` / `sourceDomain`.
- `tests/background-index.test.ts` (**mock fixes**) — fixed bootstrap-import crash: the module-top-level `initTelemetry()` call reads `chrome.runtime.getManifest().version` and invokes `isProUser().then(...)`, both of which were un-mocked. Added `chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener` + `chrome.runtime.getManifest` stubs, seeded `isProUser` with `Promise.resolve({isPro:false, plan:'free'})` default, and module-mocked `../shared/telemetry` + `../shared/telemetry-events` to no-op. Without these fixes, every `background/*` test file that transitively imports `background/index.ts` would fail to load.

#### Final Stage-3 validation (2026-05)

- `npm run typecheck` ✅ (fixed 2 pre-existing `SortMode` / `lastRenderedFilteredIds` type drifts in `sidepanel-ui.test.tsx`)
- `npm run lint` ✅ (0 errors; 1 unrelated pre-existing warning in `shared/telemetry.ts`)
- `npx prettier --check` ✅ (all files formatted)
- `npm test` → **46 files / 1,258 cases** ✅ (0 failed; 1 pre-existing flaky `telemetry.test.ts` timer case tracked separately)
- `npm run test:coverage` → `All files` Lines **80.00%** ✅ (Branch 87.26% / Funcs 88.54%)
- Per-file Stage-3 final coverage:
  - `sidepanel/pro-features.ts` **100%** (was 47.90%)
  - `sidepanel/utils.ts` **100%** (was 70.10%)
  - `sidepanel/filter.ts` **100%** (was 64.62%)
  - `sidepanel/ui.ts` **97.53%** (was 67.67%)
  - `content/monitor.ts` **82.38%** (was 75.06%)
  - `content/highlight.ts` **78.96%** (was 64.15%)
